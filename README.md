# Packet Dissection and Protocol Analysis
This project is to show how various networks behave using wireshark. This project includes real '.pcapng' captures and protocols and breakdowns to help understand how data flows through a network.
# Project Structure
  -'captures/' ~~ Real network captures in '.pcapng' format.
  -'analysis/' ~~ written breakdown of each protocol capture.

# Protocols Captured
  -HTTP ~~GET/POST request and response analysis
  -DNS ~~ Domain name resolution flow
  -IMCP ~~ Eco Request and Reply(Ping)
  -TLS ~~ SSL/TLS handshake overview 

  # Tools Used
    -Wireshark
    -Command-line tools('curl' ,'ping' ,'nslookup')
    -Markdown for documentation

 # Purpose
 this project is to:
 -Learn protocol structures and headers.
 -Understand packet-level communication.
 -Practice basic protocol analysis and network forensics
